### Assignment 2 – Pull Request Workflow (Mandatory)

**Goal:** Create a Pull Request, merge it on GitHub, then update local main with `git pull`.

1. Create a new branch:  
   `git checkout -b feature-pr-practice`
2. Create a file named `pr-practice.txt`. Write what a Pull Request is and why teams use it (4–5 lines).
3. Commit:  
   `git add .`  
   `git commit -m "Add PR practice notes"`
4. Push the branch:  
   `git push -u origin feature-pr-practice`
5. On GitHub: Open a Pull Request from `feature-pr-practice` into `main`. Write a clear PR title and description.
6. Merge the Pull Request on GitHub (use **“Create a merge commit”** option).
7. Delete the feature branch on GitHub (optional but recommended).
8. Locally:  
   `git checkout main`  
   `git pull origin main`
9. Confirm `pr-practice.txt` is now present on local main. Take a screenshot of the terminal after pull and of the merged PR on GitHub.

**Submit:** Link to the merged PR + screenshot of successful `git pull` + screenshot of GitHub PR (merged state).
