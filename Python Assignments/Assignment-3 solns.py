# All Questions and Answers are kept in commented form.

# Topic 1: Comparison Operators

# Question 1 — Predict the Output

# Predict the output before running the code.

# Answer-1:

# a = 15

# b = 20

#

# print(a < b)

# print(a > b)

# print(a == b)

# print(a != b)

# print(a <= b)

# print(a >= b)

#

# Output:

# True

# False

# False

# True

# True

# False

# Question 2 — Compare Expressions

# Predict the output.

# Answer-2:

# x = 10

# y = 10

#

# print(x == y)

# print(x != y)

# print(x < y)

# print(x <= y)

# print(x >= y)

#

# Output:

# True

# False

# False

# True

# True

#

# == is used for comparison, while = is used for assignment.

# Question 3 — Comparison with Arithmetic

# Predict the output.

# Answer-3:

# a = 10

# b = 5

#

# print(a + b == 15)

# print(a * b > 40)

# True

# True

# False

# True

# Question 4 — String Comparison

# a = int(a)

# b = int(b)

#

# print(a + b)

#

# Output:

# 30

# Correct the program so that C:\new\test is displayed.

# Answer-59:

# print("C:\new\test")

#

# Output:

# C:\new\test

#
